        <p>A balanced diet supplies the nutrients your body needs to work effectively. Without balanced nutrition, your body is more prone to disease, infection, fatigue, and low performance. Children who don’t get enough healthy foods may face growth and
            developmental problems, poor academic performance, and frequent infections. They can also develop unhealthy eating habits that may persist into adulthood. Without exercise, they’ll also have a higher risk of obesity and various diseases that
            make up metabolic syndrome, such as type 2 diabetes and high blood pressure.</p>

                <h3>What to eat for Balanced diet</h3>
                <p>A healthy, balanced diet will usually include the following nutrients: vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants carbohydrates, including starches and fiber protein healthy fats A balanced diet will include a variety of foods from the following
                    groups: 1)fruits 2)vegetables 3)grains 4)dairy 5)protein foods Examples of protein foods include meat, eggs, fish, beans, nuts, and legumes. People who follow a vegan diet will focus entirely on plant-based foods. They won’t eat meat,
                    fish, or dairy, but their diet will include other items that provide similar nutrients. Tofu and beans, for example, are plant-based sources of protein. Some people are intolerant of dairy but can still build a balanced diet by choosing
                    a variety of nutrient-rich replacements.</p>

                <h3>Fruits to be consumed</h3>
                <p>Fruits are nutritious, they make a tasty snack or dessert, and they can satisfy a sweet tooth. Local fruits that are in season are fresher and provide more nutrients than imported fruits. Fruits are high in sugar, but this sugar is natural.
                    Unlike candies and many sweet desserts, fruits also provide fiber and other nutrients. This means they’re less likely to cause a sugar spike and they’ll boost the body’s supply of essential vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants. If
                    you have diabetes, your doctor or dietitian can advise you on which fruits to choose, how much to eat, and when.</p>

                <h3>Vegetables to be consumed</h3>
                <p>Vegetables are a key source of essential vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants. Eat a variety of vegetables with different colors for a full range of nutrients. Dark, leafy greens are an excellent source of many nutrients. They include:
                    1)spinach 2)kale 3)green beans 4)broccoli 5)collard greens 6)Swiss chard 7)Local, seasonal vegetables are often reasonable in price and easy to prepare. Use them in the following ways: #as a side dish:- : roasted in a tray with a splash
                    of olive oil :as the base in soups, stews, and pasta dishes :as a salad :in purées :in juices and smoothies</p>

                <h3>Grains to be consumed</h3>
                <p>Refined white flour is featured in many breads and baked goods, but it has limited nutritional value. This is because much of the goodness is in the hull of the grain, or outer shell, which manufacturers remove during processing. Whole
                    grain products include the entire grain, including the hull. They provide additional vitamins, minerals, and fiber. Many people also find that whole grains add flavor and texture to a dish. Try switching from white breads, pastas,
                    and rice to whole grain options</p>

                <h3>Proteins to be consumed</h3>
                <p>Meats and beans are primary sources of protein, which is essential for wound healing and muscle maintenance and development, among other functions. Animal protein Healthy animal-based options include: 1)red meats, such as beef and mutton
                    2)poultry, such as chicken and turkey 3)fish, including salmon, sardines, and other oily fish 4)Processed meats and red meats may increase the risk of cancer and other diseases, according to some researchTrusted Source. Some processed
                    meats also contain a lot of added preservatives and salt. Fresh, unprocessed meat is the best option. Plant-based protein Nuts, beans, and soy products are good sources of protein, fiber, and other nutrients. Examples include: lentils
                    beans peas almonds sunflower seeds walnuts Tofu, tempeh, and other soy-based products are excellent sources of protein and are healthy alternatives to meat.</p>

                <h3>Dairy to be consumed</h3>
                <p>Dairy products provide essential nutrients, including: 1)protein 2)calcium 3)vitamin D 4)They also contain fat. If you’re seeking to limit your fat intake, reduced fat options might be best. Your doctor can help you decide. For those following
                    a vegan diet, many dairy-free milks and other dairy alternatives are now available, made from: *flax seed *almonds and cashews *soy *oats *coconut These are often fortified with calcium and other nutrients, making them excellent alternatives
                    to dairy from cows. Some have added sugar, so read the label carefully when choosing</p>

                <h3>Fats and oils to be consumed</h3>
                <p>Fat is essential for energy and cell health, but too much fat can increase calories above what the body needs and may lead to weight gain. In the past, guidelines have recommended avoiding saturated fats, due to concerns that they would
                    raise cholesterol levels. More recent researchTrusted Source suggests that partially replacing with unsaturated fats lowers cardiovascular disease risk and that some saturated fat should remain in the diet — about 10 percent or less
                    of calories. Trans fats, however, should still be avoided. Recommendations on fats can sometimes be hard to follow, but one scientistTrusted Source has proposed the following guideline: --Fats to love: vegetable oils and fish oils
                    --Fats to limit: butter, cheese, and heavy cream --Fats to lose: trans fats, used in many processed and premade foods, such as donuts --Most experts consider olive oil to be a healthy fat, and especially extra virgin olive oil, which
                    is the least processed type. Deep fried foods are often high in calories but low in nutritional value, so you should eat them sparingly.</p>

        <h4>Putting it all together</h4>
        <p>A healthy diet will combine all the nutrients and foods groups mentioned above, but you need to balance them, too. A handy way to remember how much of each food group to eat is the plate method. The USDA’s “ChooseMyPlate” initiative recommends:
            filling half your plate with fruits and vegetables filling just over one quarter with grains filling just under one quarter with protein foods adding dairy on the side (or a nondairy replacement) But individual needs will vary, so the provides
            an interactive tool, “MyPlate Plan” where you can enter your own details to find out your personal needs.
